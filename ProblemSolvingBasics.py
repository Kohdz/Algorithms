# Undestanding a problem:

# Computational problems have an input and an output

# Problem is defined by possible inputs (set) and relationship
# beteen the inputs and desired outputs

# Solution to a problem: a procedue is something that can
# take any input and return the desired output
# that satifies the relationship

# 1. Understand the possible Inputs. What are the inputs?
#    - talk about your assumptioms
#    - talk about ranges
#    - how are the inputs represented

# 2. Understand the possible Outputs. What are the outputs?
#   -
#   -

# 3. Solve the Problem. How can i map the inputs to the outputs
#   - walk though a sample input and the desired output
#   - write pesudo code
#   - brake problem into smaller peices and solve each one
#           - think about using helper functions

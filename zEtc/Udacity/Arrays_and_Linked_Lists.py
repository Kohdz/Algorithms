# Collection
#   - just a group of things

# Lists
#   - a type of collections but no order
#    -  no fixed length
#    -

# Array
#   - the most common implementation of an list
#   - no order
#   - each array has aa location called an index
#   - an index is a number associated with that place in the array
#   - insertion at middle parts is messy due to having to shift
#   - Array Stored In Memory
#       - when an array is create it is given some initial size
#       - computer finds a block of memory and sets it aside for the array
#       - the memory is one continuous block
#       - all the elements are the same size

#  Array vs. Lists
#   - element of a list may or may not be next to each other
#   - not that a list in python is essentially an array
#   - specifically it behaves like a dynamic array
#   - elements in the list are contiguous

# Linked List
#  - adding or removing elements in a linked list is easy
#  -

# Linked List vs. Array
#   -in an array you store two numbers, the value and index
#   - in a linked list you store value and the pointer to next element
#   - the last element points to nothing
#   - adding elements or deleting is simply changing pointers
#   - adding and removing elements are constant

# Given a non-negative int n, compute recursively (no loops) the count of the occurrences of 8 as a digit,
#  except that an 8 with another 8 immediately to its left counts double, so 8818 yields 4.
#   Note that mod (%) by 10 yields the rightmost digit (126 % 10 is 6), while divide (/) by 10
#    removes the rightmost digit (126 / 10 is 12).


# count8(8) → 1
# count8(818) → 2
# count8(8818) → 4

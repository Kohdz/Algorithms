# Project Euler #49: Prime permutations

# [Prime Permutations]
# The arithmetic sequence, 1487, 4817, 8147, in which each of the terms increases by 3330, is unusual in two ways:
# Each of the three terms are prime
# Each of the 4-digit numbers are permutations of one another.
# There are no arithmetic sequences made up of three 1-, 2-, or 3-digit primes, exhibiting this property,
#  but there is one other 4-digit increasing sequence.
# What 12-digit number do you form by concatenating the three terms in this sequence?

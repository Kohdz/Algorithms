# 1. Write a function to sort even/odd number; put even numbers first and odd numbers at the ends
# what is the complexity
# A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] #[2, 4, 1, 3, 5]

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2.  Write a program that takes an array A and an index i into A, and rearranges the elements such that
# all elements less than A[i] (the "pivot") appears first, followed by elements equal to the pivot,
# followed by elements greater than the pivot.
# what is the complexity

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 3.  Write a program which takes as input an array of digits encoding a non-negative decimal interger D and
# updates the array to represent the integer D + 1. For example, if the input is <1, 2, 9> then you should
# update the array to <1, 3, 0>. Your algorithm should work even if it is implemented in a language that has
# finite-precision arithmetic
# what is the complexity
# A = [1, 2, 9] #[1, 3, 0]

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 4. Write a program that takes two arrays representing integers and returns an integer representing their product
# For example since 193707721 x - 761838257287 = -147573952589676412927, if the inputs are < 1, 9, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 2, 1 >
# and < -7, 6, 1, 8, 3, 8, 2, 5, 7, 2, 8, 7 > , your function should return
# < -1, 4, 7, 5, 7, 3, 9, 5, 2, 5, 8, 9, 6, 7, 6, 4, 1, 2, 9, 2, 7 >.

# num1 = [1, 9, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 2, 1]
# num2 = [-7, 6, 1, 8, 3, 8, 2, 5, 7, 2, 8, 7]

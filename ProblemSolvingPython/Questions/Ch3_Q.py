# 1. Implement an Algorithm that balances the following parentheses
# 	→ ((())) and (()()())
# 	→ must use a stack

    # Code Goes Here


# 2.  Write a helper function to make the balanced parenthesis problem more general
# 	→ { { ( [ ] [ ] ) } ( ) }
# 	→  [ [ { { ( ( ) ) } } ] ]
# 	→  ( ( ( ) ] ) )
# 	→  [ ] [ ] [ ] ( ) { }
